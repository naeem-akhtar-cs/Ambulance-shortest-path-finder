# Path-Finder-Using-A_Star-Algorithm
Application to find the shortest path for Ambulance using A* Algorithm

## Description
### What is in Repository
This repository contains a .cpp file of code implementing A* ALgorithm on maze from the file map.txt. The pdf file has all the description of project. It is actually a Requirements file.

### Project Description
This project is about finding the path apecified in map.txt using A* Algorithm. It uses A* Algorithm to find the shortest route.

## Menu
There are two options for the user.
  1. Run the ambulance manually
  2. Find the hsortest path with A*

 ## Finding Path
 Screen below shows the path specified using "--" as shortest path from all the routes.
 
 ## How to Run:

You can run this .ccp file in any c++ compiler. But remember before running the program keep map.txt in the directory.
